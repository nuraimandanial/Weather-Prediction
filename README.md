We decided to create a weather prediction model for our group assignment. We chose this project to step out of our comfort zone and test our abilities to analyze, train, and execute the task.

Our main challenge at that time was finding a suitable dataset to begin our work. Initially, we compiled all the datasets we could find, and we ultimately decided on one from Kaggle.

After that we start by doing task deviation so each of us can contribute and make sure our work is being done with each of our own specialization.

We try to always have a weekly meeting and communicate using our WhatsApp group. This not only allows us to get updates on our progress but also ensures our communication is streamlined, which immensely helps avoid miscommunication among team members.

This report details the analysis and prediction of weather conditions using historical weather data. The focus is on hypothesis testing for specific features and the training of predictive models.
